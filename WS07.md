# Workshop 07
## Hello and welcome back!
This final optional task is a little test for you to take the training wheels off and figure out steps on your own. We will build a nice little template for having multiple states in your project...

Here's what you can make, click on the buttons and interact with the dat.gui panel to see how it all works...

        style="width:100%;height:500px;border:0;overflow:hidden" 
        title="W07_FiniteState_END" 
        allow="accelerometer; ambient-light-sensor; camera; encrypted-media; geolocation; gyroscope; 
               hid; microphone; midi; payment; usb; vr; xr-spatial-tracking" 
        sandbox="allow-forms allow-modals allow-popups allow-presentation allow-same-origin allow-scripts">

*Where code is provided, you are expected to write it out yourself rather than copying and pasting it. We know this is tempting, but the point of a university education is for you to learn the necessary skills for your field, and copying and pasting code will not be on any job descriptions.*

## Task 1 - Having a Go
Right, it's up to you to have a go at adapting this starter code. You can put your own states in or try and do the same as the above example.

        style="width:100%;height:250px;border:0;overflow:hidden" 
        title="W07_starter" 
        allow="accelerometer; ambient-light-sensor; camera; encrypted-media; geolocation; gyroscope; 
               hid; microphone; midi; payment; usb; vr; xr-spatial-tracking" 
        sandbox="allow-forms allow-modals allow-popups allow-presentation allow-same-origin allow-scripts">

## That's it for this week
Ideally you'll have completed your own state machine now. Hopefully the template will come in useful for your Mini Project assignment. Nice one! ðŸ˜€

Super important final task: go to `file->export to .zip` in your codesandbox and download your project!

Remember "the cloud is just someone elses computer" - so it's critical to keep backups (and in well named folders so you can find stuff later). Download and save your work in a folder for "CPC week 8".
