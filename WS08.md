# Workshop 08 - runner (p1 of 2)
## Hello and welcome back!
## This is optional!
This last example that we're going to work through is something that puts a lot of the things that we've been looking at over the previous weeks into one applied project: an endless runner type of game/web-toy. 

It is, by it's nature, bigger and more complex than the stuff we've been working on so far. So we've supplied the structure in terms of the main classes, so you can understand how to go about designing the visual, interaction and sonic elements of the piece as we go. It is critical that you read every line/block of code in order to understand what's going on...

Right, preamble over, over the next couple of weeks we will:

 - Work from starter code provided that you will fork a new codesandbox from. This is  because, to hit the ground running, we've designed the structure of the piece to let you understand how the parts all fit together...
 - Create a game-type of environment with ground plane, then see how we can manipulate vertices and faces to create some interesting effects.
 - Add some nice lighting and fog to our environment.
 - Add an avatar into our world, then start moving through our scene.
 - Put some obstacles into the scene, in this case it will be trees.
 - Look at one of the key mechanics in creative/game-based coding: collision detection.
 - Challenge you a bit more to think about what's going on in the code by describing to what should happen; getting you to have a go at programming it yourself; then allowing you to see our solutions.

Here's what we're making, use the left and right arrow keys to move the avatar around...

**Where code is provided, you are expected to write it out yourself rather than copying and pasting it. We know this is tempting, but the point of a university education is for you to learn the necessary skills for your field, and copying and pasting code will not be on any job descriptions.**

## Task 1 - Creating the ground
Right, we're going to use a starter project again. **So please fork the starer sandbox below**. 

As in the previous week's starter code, it's basically just our normal template but we've added some a couple of other pre-defined class files for you to work with. 

 - Which JS files are importing which libraries/other JS files?

This time we've already added all the global variables, so let's get cracking with creating a ground plane

## Part 1
Take a look through the `Environment` class to get an understanding of how it's working. **Now, back in index.js around line 83 where it's specified**, create a new instance of Environment and assign it to the variable called "ground". 

 - As you can see from the constructor of Environment, we need to pass our scene in as an argument. How do you do this?

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Hopefully you should have been able to do this yourself, but just in case here is the line that is required...</summary>

```javascript
ground = new Environment(scene);
```

</details>

Try just enabling the orbit controls for a second to see what's going on with this plane. That means finding the line that says `orbit.enabled = false;` and setting it to true. **Refresh the codesandbox browser to take a look in the scene.**

 - Remember to set it back to false once you've taken a look around.

## Part 2
Right, so that ground plane is kind of, well, plain...! If you cast your mind back to week 03 when we were talking about using noise to manipulate vertices of objects [(this example)](https://codesandbox.io/s/w03noisespheremanipulation-n64kw?file=/src/index.js), well that's what we're going to do here.

First we're going to iterate over the vertices of the plane and add a bit of randomness to the x and y positions.

Then, we're going to assign a random colour to each vertex of the face. Faces are triangular shapes used to compute the "skin" of a particular object. We're going to use Hue Saturation and Value colour space to set the colours, as it's easier to get ranges within a certain colour this way. Here is a (link to more info on faces)[https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/core/Face3.vertexColors] if you would like some.

OK, now go into the runnerObjects.js file and around line 16, after we've created the plane geometry, add the following code:

```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < this.geometry.vertices.length; i++) 
{
      //iterate through plane vertices and slightly randmise x and y positions to create some variation in the plane
      let vertex = this.geometry.vertices[i];
      vertex.x += Math.random() * 30 - 15;
      vertex.y += Math.random() * 30 - 15;
    }

    for (let i = 0, l = this.geometry.faces.length; i < l; i++) {
      // iterate through faces of plane geometry and randomise the colour to be varitions of green
      let face = this.geometry.faces[i];
      face.vertexColors[0] = new THREE.Color().setHSL(
        // Hue Saturation and Value (HSL) are easier to use for randomisation within a certain colour
        0.33, //green
        THREE.MathUtils.randFloat(0.5, 0.8), //randomise saturation between 0.5 and 0.8
        THREE.MathUtils.randFloat(0.5, 0.8) //randomise value between 0.5 and 0.8
      );
      face.vertexColors[1] = new THREE.Color().setHSL(
        0.33,
        THREE.MathUtils.randFloat(0.5, 0.8), //randomise saturation between 0.5 and 0.8
        THREE.MathUtils.randFloat(0.5, 0.8) //randomise value between 0.5 and 0.8
      );
      face.vertexColors[2] = new THREE.Color().setHSL(
        0.33,
        THREE.MathUtils.randFloat(0.5, 0.8), //randomise saturation between 0.5 and 0.8
        THREE.MathUtils.randFloat(0.5, 0.8) //randomise value between 0.5 and 0.8
      );
    }
```

Now, one last bit, we need to update our material to use vertexColors instead of a normal colour. So head into the part just below where we create our material and update it accordingly with the code below:

```javascript
vertexColors: THREE.VertexColors //ensure vertex colours is set so that we can use the randomsation
```

OK, we've got a bit of texture on our plane now, good stuff!

## Task 2 - Lighting/Shadows and Fog
So, we've got some texture, but it would be good to add some visual effects to our scene. So we're going to add a directional light, and this time we're going to ensure it casts a wide shadow to that all the objects in our scene will be bathed in light but will also cast a shadow onto the ground plane, to help give a sense of realism.

(See this link for more info on lights and shadow)[https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/lights/shadows/DirectionalLightShadow]

Now, we might not see the results of this until task 3, but it's important that we get it set up now. There are quite a few lines below but they're essentially just specifying, the near and far planes of the shadow limits, all the corner edges of the shadow limits and then making sure our shadow map (the resolution of the shadow) is nice and detailed.

So go and add the following code in correct place in the init() function in index.js. It is labelled, and should go just beneath where you initialise the directional light.

```javascript
  light.position.set(-20, 50, -5); // set the light's initial position
  light.castShadow = true; // ensure that this light will cast a shadow
  // Please read here for more information about the below: https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/lights/shadows/DirectionalLightShadow
  light.shadow.camera.near = 0.5;
  light.shadow.camera.far = 5000;
  light.shadow.camera.left = -500;
  light.shadow.camera.bottom = -500;
  light.shadow.camera.right = 500;
  light.shadow.camera.top = 500;
  light.shadow.mapSize.width = 2048;
  light.shadow.mapSize.height = 2048;
```

## Part 2
Right now we're going to set our scene's background to all white using HEX values. And we're going to add some fog so that it obscures the horizon a bit and objects will appear out of the mist! These are both things we've done before so have a think about what should go where in the `init()` function in index.js.

(Take a look here if you need more information about how to create the fog effect...)[https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/scenes/FogExp2]

<details markdown="1">
<summary>If you're really struggling, these are the two lines of code that will set our background to white and add the fog...</summary>

```javascript
scene.background = new THREE.Color(0xffffff); // set white background
scene.fog = new THREE.FogExp2(0xf0fff0, 0.006); // create some fog for VFX
```

</details>

So now you can see that we've whited out our scene with making a white background and adding some fog. Things are looking good, but nothing is moving yet?! That's our next task...

## Task 3 - Adding our Avatar and getting things moving
