# Workshop 02 - tooling up
## Hello and welcome!
This second workshop will get you up to speed with making all the building blocks for a creative computing three js project. In this workshop we will:
 - Play about with some basic HTML/CSS/JS 
 - Create our first project in codesandbox
 - Make a basic Three js scene with a spinny cube and play a looping soundfile - kind of like the "hello world" of 3D Web creative computing!

**Where code is provided, you are expected to write it out yourself rather than copying and pasting it. We know this is tempting, but the point of a university education is for you to learn the necessary skills for your field, and copying and pasting code will not be on any job descriptions.**
    

## Task 1 - Tooling Up
OK, so here goes with our first task, we're just going to get to know our development environment a bit. For the first semester, we will be using the most bleeding edge tools on the interplex to facilitate our learning and creativity. 

No, we don't mean Phill and Luke, we mean codesandbox, Three.js and Tone.js!

Generally we provide codesandbox links for a *here's what we are building* example and a *starting point* for you to build up from.

Click on the "open sandox" button in the bottom right hand corner of the *starting point* sandbox and it will open up a new tab with that sandbox ready for you to explore and extend it. ðŸ˜€ 

The "fork" button in the top right (of the opened tab) duplicates everything in your personal codesandbox account if you have one set up.

For the rest of the semester **you will be working in multiple browser tabs** for these worksheets.

## You will work from this starting point

     sandbox="allow-forms allow-modals allow-popups allow-presentation allow-same-origin allow-scripts"
   ></iframe>
   
Take a look around the starter codesandbox above. You should be able to see that there are tabs across the top with various different
    file names: `index.js`, `package.json`, `styles.css`, and `index.html`

`index.js` is actually empty right now apart from a couple of <code>import</code> statements. In modern JavaScript, we are able to import modules that allow us to use other peoples' libraries with ease.

As you'll be aware from the lecture, we're using Three.js and this is the syntax we use to get Three into our index.js so we can start using it. More will be explained later.

## A quick demo
Just to demonstrate how quickly we can start to develop our web project we're going to add a divider `<div>` and within that make a button `<button>` that says "play" on it.

Head into the `index.html` tab and add the following HTML elements on a new line just after the `<body>` tag and before the '<script>' tag:
  
```html
<div id="overlay">
	<button id="startButton">Play</button>
</div>
```
	
You should see a button appear saying "play" on it - that button won't do anything yet but you can see how quickly we can build an interface... You can also add a bunch of other HTML elements if you want to customise your page.
  
Now, as we talked about in the lecture, codesandbox is a development environment that kind of bridges the gap between prototyping playground and pro developers sharing ideas.

I'm not going to big it up too much but it's **RUDDY GREAT**

It gives us a fully functional development environment with nice code editor, embedded test-browser and console all within the comfy home of our favourite web browser.

We can also collaboratively edit code together, which in these remote-times is pretty incredible and will allow us to help you along the way. There are a whole lot of other features but let's just leave it there to stop me talking about how wonderful it is...

**Please now go to <a href="https://codesandbox.io/" target="_blank">codesandbox</a>** and create an account, we recommend using your UWE email but you can also use a personal one if you'd prefer.

# Task 2 - The Unholy Trinity: HTML/CSS/JavaScript

This is the basic "vanilla" starter that you get with codesandbox<

OK now we're going to do a few more steps just to display the current time:
 - Add another html `<div>` element in index.html with an id named "demo" **HINT:** try taking a look at task 1 to see how to do that, remember we need a pair of tags
 - You won't necessarily see anything yet but we're going to add our timer function
 - Now, in `index.js` (NOT index.html) try doing a timed operation with setInterval to display time using the following code:
    
```javascript
let timer = setInterval(myTimer, 1000); // declare a variable, assign the setInterval function supplying myTimer as the callback with a 1 second interval
function myTimer() 
{
  let d = new Date();
  document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = d.toLocaleTimeString();
}
```
Do this in the starter sandbox below:
<iframe src="https://codesandbox.io/embed/cpc-w02-t02-zx4rpi?fontsize=14&hidenavigation=1&theme=dark"
     style="width:100%; height:250px; border:0; border-radius: 4px; overflow:hidden;"

     sandbox="allow-forms allow-modals allow-popups allow-presentation allow-same-origin allow-scripts"
   ></iframe>

So you should be able to see how quickly we can *dynamically* update our index.html through the use of JavaScript and the power of codesandbox. But let's face it, that's not particularly creative, and we're here to make some shapes and noises, so let's move on to using Three.js to create a simple scene

# Task 3 - Three.js
## Task 3.1

 - OK, now we've created a new vanilla codesandbox below, but you can do this by navigating to the main site (not the one embedded below) so go and give that a try using your new account.
 - Right, we're just going to repeat task 1 now and add our overlay and buttons in index.html
 - Then let's just delete everything in index.js apart from the first line where we import styles.css
 - In the sandbox below, we've taken care of the styling for now, but try styling your play button using the id (<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_buttons.asp" target="_blank">Here</a> is a short tut on how you do that)

<iframe src="https://codesandbox.io/embed/cpc-w02-t03-01-ct6r23?fontsize=14&hidenavigation=1&theme=dark"
     style="width:100%; height:250px; border:0; border-radius: 4px; overflow:hidden;"
     title="CPC_W02_T03_01"
     allow="accelerometer; ambient-light-sensor; camera; encrypted-media; geolocation; gyroscope; hid; microphone; midi; payment; usb; vr; xr-spatial-tracking"
     sandbox="allow-forms allow-modals allow-popups allow-presentation allow-same-origin allow-scripts"
   ></iframe>

## Task 3.2
From now on, we're going to have to work across two browser tabs: this workshop page and your codesandbox project. We've embedded the codesandboxes for each step below so you can see where we get to each after each step.
 
First of all we need to add the Three.js library as a dependency in our project. This is basically just telling our codesandbox "hey please include this file when building as we're going to import it into our project". To do this, navigate to the dependencies dropdown (in the explorer tab on the left or in the top left burger menu if you're using the embedded sandbox below). Then in the "add dependency" field just type "three" and click to add the dependency. Simple!

Now we're going to add some lines at the very top of our index.js that import our Three.js library and also a thing called OrbitControls which will allow us to interact with our project to scroll around using the mouse:

```javascript
import * as THREE from "three";
import { OrbitControls } from "three/examples/jsm/controls/OrbitControls.js";
import "./styles.css";
```

 - We're going to create a whole bunch of variables that we're going to use later (some we won't actually use in this workshop). These should all be fairly familiar from the first lecture but will become clear as we go on...
 - Next, we're going to assign start button to variable and add the `init()` function as the "click" callback by using the `addEventListener()` method. This means that `init()` will be called when the button is clicked

```javascript
let scene, camera, renderer;
let geometry, material, cube;
let colour, intensity, light;
let ambientLight;

let orbit;

let listener, sound, audioLoader;

let clock, delta, interval;

let startButton = document.getElementById("startButton");
startButton.addEventListener("click", init);
```
    
OK for now, we're just going to add an alert() in the our init() function to ensure that we have everything working and we can move on to the next step:

```javascript
function init() {
    	alert("We have initialised!");
    }
```
## Task 3.3
Here's where we got to, feel free to work from this one if you ran into any errors on the last task, we're going easy in these first couple of sessions ðŸ˜€

<iframe src="https://codesandbox.io/embed/cpc-w02-t03-02-9dyyrz?fontsize=14&hidenavigation=1&theme=dark"
     style="width:100%; height:250px; border:0; border-radius: 4px; overflow:hidden;"
     title="CPC_W02_T03_02"
     allow="accelerometer; ambient-light-sensor; camera; encrypted-media; geolocation; gyroscope; hid; microphone; midi; payment; usb; vr; xr-spatial-tracking"
     sandbox="allow-forms allow-modals allow-popups allow-presentation allow-same-origin allow-scripts"
   ></iframe>
   
This is a bit of a big chunk as we're now going to set up all the various bits and pieces we talked about in the lecture in terms of the building blocks of a Three.js project.

At the top of the init() function, delete the alert as we're no longer going to need that. Then, the first thing we're going to do is remove the overlay once our "play" button is pressed, so add this code <strong> inside </strong> the init() function:

```javascript
  // remove overlay
  let overlay = document.getElementById("overlay");
  overlay.remove();
```

Right, below the section of removing the overlay but still in the the init() function, let's make our scene and set the background to a light grey:
```javascript
  //create our scene
  scene = new THREE.Scene();
  scene.background = new THREE.Color(0xdfdfdf);
```
	
Still within the init() function, we're going to add another fundamental part of our project, the camera. We initialise the camera with the folling parameters: 
 - fov - Camera frustum vertical field of view.
 - aspect - Camera frustum aspect ratio.
 - near - Camera frustum near plane.
 - far - Camera frustum far plane.

```javascript
  //create camera
  camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(
    75,
    window.innerWidth / window.innerHeight,
    0.1,
    1000
  );
```	
Beneath that but still in the init() function, let's just move the camera back a bit on the z axis by accessing its position propery using the got operator and assigning it to the number 5. This will ensure we can actually see the stuff we're drawing later and we're not INSIDE it looking out:

`camera.position.z = 5;`
    
Still within init(), we're going to create our renderer. This is the bit that is actually going to draw our cool stuff to the screen. We're going to enable anti aliasing (see <a href=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spatial_anti-aliasing" target="_blank">here</a> for a bit more info about what that is. And then we're going to add our renderer to our HTML page. This creates a HTML5 canvas and enables WebGL to create our 3D world:

```javascript
  //specify our renderer and add it to our document
  renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer({ antialias: true });
  renderer.setSize(window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight);
  document.body.appendChild(renderer.domElement);
```
	
Finally, still within init() we're going to create our orbit controls which will let us interact with the scene and change the position of the camera using our mouse. Just a couple of lines, and then in the last line of init() we will call our play() function which we'll define below:>

```javascript
  //create the orbit controls instance so we can use the mouse move around our scene
  orbit = new OrbitControls(camera, renderer.domElement);
  orbit.enableZoom = true;
  play();
```

OK below our init() function let's define our play() and stop() functions. In the play() function, we supply an anonymous function to the renderer which will loop continually and that will call our update() function and our render() function (defined below). This is essentially the basics of building a game engine structure. The stop() function will just be there to kill the game loop if need be: 
	
```javascript
// start animating
function play() 
{
  //using the new setAnimationLoop method which means we are WebXR ready if need be
  renderer.setAnimationLoop(() => {
    update();
    render();
  });
}
// stop animating (not currently used)
function stop() {
  renderer.setAnimationLoop(null);
}
```
  
Right, nearly there. Below play() and stop() let's add our update() function. As you can see, this will be called on loop by the renderer. For now, we're just going to update our orbit controls object like so:

```javascript
//our update function
function update() 
{
  orbit.update();
  //update stuff in here
}
```

And then finally at this stage, we're going create our render function in which we will pass our scene and camera to the renderer to render!

```javascript
// simple render function
function render() 
{
  renderer.render(scene, camera);
}
```
	
But, argh! We still can't see anything apart from a blank screen as we haven't actually put anything into our scene yet! All that for a blank screen?! Well, not to worry, this whole exercise is building us a template which we can reuse again and again in later tutorials.

## Task 3.4
Here's a sandbox which should match where you got to after that last mammoth step:

<iframe src="https://codesandbox.io/embed/cpc-w02-t03-03-vzthg1?fontsize=14&hidenavigation=1&theme=dark"
     style="width:100%; height:250px; border:0; border-radius: 4px; overflow:hidden;"
     title="W02_T03_03"
     allow="accelerometer; ambient-light-sensor; camera; encrypted-media; geolocation; gyroscope; hid; microphone; midi; payment; usb; vr; xr-spatial-tracking"
     sandbox="allow-forms allow-modals allow-popups allow-presentation allow-same-origin allow-scripts"
   ></iframe>

We need to add some light and an object to our scene. 
	
Head back into the init() function, just above the bit where we call play().
Add a couple of lights to our scene, one directional and one ambient:

```javascript
  // lighting
  colour = 0xffffff;
  intensity = 1;
  light = new THREE.DirectionalLight(colour, intensity);
  light.position.set(-1, 2, 4);
  scene.add(light);
  ambientLight = new THREE.AmbientLight(0xffffff, 0.5);
  scene.add(ambientLight);
```
	
Now, remember what we were talking about in the lecture regarding the fact that meshes are made up of geometries and materials. Let's create a very simple cube with a basic materials:

```javascript
// create a box to spin
  geometry = new THREE.BoxGeometry();
  material = new THREE.MeshNormalMaterial(); 
  cube = new THREE.Mesh(geometry, material);

  scene.add(cube);
```

# Is this thing on?
Hopefully you can now see a cube?! 

If not, one common mistake is to forget to include the following line (to move the camera out from the default position, inside the cube!)
	
 `camera.position.z = 5;`

When you can see the cube, let's edit the update() function to manipulate the properties of our cube and spin it around a bit.

```javascript
//our update function
function update() {
  orbit.update();
  //update stuff in here
  cube.rotation.x += 0.01;
  cube.rotation.y += 0.04;
  cube.rotation.z -= 0.01;
}
```
So, this has been a long time coming but **because we've worked in this way it's now very easy for us to animate anything in the scene.**
	
# Experiment time
 - What happens if you change cube.rotation.x to cube.position.x?
 - What periodic function could be used to move the the cube back and forth?
 - Can you animate the directional light intensity?
	
## Task 4

As we discussed in the lecture, one of the things that makes this module different from others around and about is that it is focused on audio-visual stuff, rather than just visual or just audio. With that in mind, let's add a sound to our project. Here's where we got to after task 3 
    
<iframe src="https://codesandbox.io/embed/cpc-w02-t03-04-4sq9ee?fontsize=14&hidenavigation=1&theme=dark"
     style="width:100%; height:250px; border:0; border-radius: 4px; overflow:hidden;"
     title="CPC_W02_T03_04"
     allow="accelerometer; ambient-light-sensor; camera; encrypted-media; geolocation; gyroscope; hid; microphone; midi; payment; usb; vr; xr-spatial-tracking"
     sandbox="allow-forms allow-modals allow-popups allow-presentation allow-same-origin allow-scripts"
   ></iframe>
	
**Feel free to fork this step in your own codesandbox account if your previous steps haven't gone so well. Be sure to review what went wrong at some point tho, it will help you develop debugging skills!**

For now, we're just going to use Three.js's sound capabilities which allow us to play back sound files and some simple panning etc. Hopefully you're now comfortable with the interface of codesandbox. So make a new folder in the root directory (i.e a new folder outside the one called "src") in your codesandbox project 
    and call it "sounds".

Use the upload button to upload a sound file. Ideally we will use a .mp3 as they're smaller. We made a <a href="sounds/CPC_Basic_Drone_Loop.mp3" target="_blank">simple looping drone sound called CPC_Basic_Drone_Loop.mp3</a> that you can download if you'd prefer to use this to get going quickly. Download it then upload to your "sounds" folder on codesandbox.
    
OK so let's head back into our init() function again. We're going to go **just above that final line where we call play()** and add some stuff so that we can generate and listen to sound. We're going to make a `listener` (a virtual pair of ears which we will attach to our camera), then we will create a sound emitter which will play back audio. The result will be nice positional audio panning depending on where the camera is.

```javascript
  //sound for single source and single listener
  listener = new THREE.AudioListener();
  camera.add(listener);
  sound = new THREE.PositionalAudio(listener);
```	

Finally, we're going to setup the playback buffer of our sound emitter with the loaded mp3 file, and set a bunch of parameters on our positional audio object to that it loops and plays audio in a specific direction etc: 
	
```javascript
  audioLoader = new THREE.AudioLoader();
  audioLoader.load("./sounds/CPC_Basic_Drone_Loop.mp3", function (buffer) {
    sound.setBuffer(buffer);
    sound.setRefDistance(10);
    sound.setDirectionalCone(180, 230, 0.1);
    sound.setLoop(true);
    sound.setVolume(0.5);
    sound.play();
  });
```
    
OK cool, try moving around your 3D world and experiment with how the sound changes based on the position of the camera!
	
## Task 5
    
"Just one more thing..." as Columbo would say. Being as how we're in a web browser and those pesky users of our stuff might resize their window. We need to add some code in our main template to ensure that our scene gets resized accordingly.

Let's define a couple of variable **towards the top of index.js**:	
	
```javascript
let sceneHeight, sceneWidth;
```

Then, just above where we create our new scene in the init() function, let's initialise those variables to be the window sizes:

```javascript
sceneWidth = window.innerWidth;
sceneHeight = window.innerHeight;
```

Now, towards the **bottom of init(), just before we call play()**, let's add a thing called an event listener. This is will react when it senses the window being resized and call a function called onWindowResize:

```javascript
window.addEventListener("resize", onWindowResize, false);
```

Finally, right at the bottom of your index.js, let's define the onWindowResize function. This just updates our variables and sets the new size of the scene based on the window size...

```javascript
function onWindowResize() 
{
  //resize & align
  sceneHeight = window.innerHeight;
  sceneWidth = window.innerWidth;
  renderer.setSize(sceneWidth, sceneHeight);
  camera.aspect = sceneWidth / sceneHeight;
  camera.updateProjectionMatrix();
}
```

## Back up your work
Right we're at the final task for this workshop **hooray, Nice one for making our "hello world"!** Remember that this is a template that we can work from from now on. It's really important that you save the completed thing (and name it so you can find it) in your personal codesandbox account.
	
Super important task: go to `file->export to .zip` in your codesandbox and download your project as a zip.

Remember, files in the cloud are just files on someone elses computer. It is critical to keep a good backup. Make sure you start as you mean to go on and make a "CPC" folder for this module, then another folder inside that one called "Template" to save your exported zip.

## Stretch goal - gridhelper
One final thing to experiment with, try adding a <a href="https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/helpers/GridHelper" target="_blank">grid helper</a> to your scene and see how that changes the visual landscape. This is a tiny stretch goal so we're not going to tell you exactly how to do it!
